## Introduction to TCGA Pan-Cancer Dataset

-   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
-   Establishing coordinated effort to characterize molecular events in primary cancers
    -   Collection of clinicopathologic annotation data along with multi-platform molecular profiles of more than 11,000 human tumors across 33 different cancer type

::: fragment
-   Our data is composed of the 6 cancer types with most patients included
:::

-   Significance of the Pan-Cancer dataset in cancer genomics research
-   Pan-cancer dataset allows for simultaneous analysis of genomic data across a diverse range of cancer types

::: fragment
-   Dataset is crucial for discovering shared molecular features, potential biomarkers and theurapeutic targets
:::

::: fragment
-   Contributing to more effective and personalized cancer treatments
:::

-   How this dataset helps in understanding cancer at a molecular level

::: fragment
-   Data includes genetic mutations, gene expression profiles, epigenetic changes and other molecular alterations associated with diverse cancers
:::

::: fragment
-   This dataset facilitates a nuanced understanding of molecular intricacies of cancer
:::

::: fragment
-   Data set helps allowing identification of patterns and shared characteristics among different cancer types\
:::

## Project Aim and Focus

-   To perform an in-depth TCGA Pan-Cancer analysis, focusing on survival analysis

::: fragment
-   Explore and understand factors influencing survival outcomes within the TCGA dataset
:::

-   Cox proportional hazards models to gain insights into cancer prognosis

::: fragment
-   Cox proportional hazard model used in survival analysis to assess impact of covarities
:::

::: fragment

## Data Acquisition and Cleaning
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}
::: fragment
-   Data retrieved and loaded using read_excel()
:::
:::

::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}
::: fragment
-   Raw data is a 11.160 x 34 sized tibble
:::
:::

::: {style="font-size: 30%;"}
::: fragment
```{r}
#| label: load data to tibble
#| message: false
#| warning: false


library(tidyverse)

## Data Transformation and Tools

-   Explain the data transformation and augmentation techniques used.

-   Highlight the use of Tidyverse in RStudio for data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Insights

- Distribution of Cancer Types by Gender

## Interpreting the Model

::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}
::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
-   Direct comparison of HR across cancer types without stratification
    -   Understanding relative risks associated with each factor

::: fragment
-   GMB stands out - Risk of death nine times greater
:::

::: fragment
-   Age - Risk of death increases slightly with each additional year
:::

::: fragment
-   Gender - No significant difference based on gender
:::

::: fragment
-   Cancer stage - Stage 4 risk of death six times greater
:::
